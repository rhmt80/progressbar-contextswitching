    The project report has been attached for reference

This project presents a dynamic progress bar with pre-emptive scheduling and thread
management, offering practical insights into concurrent process management.
Preemptive scheduling refers to a method where the operating system can interrupt ongoing
tasks to prioritise and manage the execution of multiple processes efficiently. In this context,
it likely means that the progress bar manages and updates multiple tasks concurrently,
allowing for smooth and efficient task allocation and execution.
Threads are individual sequences of programmed instructions within a process. Effective
thread management involves handling these threads efficiently, possibly by allocating
system resources, managing their execution, and ensuring synchronisation where needed.
The project likely involves managing threads to update the progress bar and execute tasks
concurrently.


    Applications:
  1. Data Transfer Visualisations: Showing the progress of data transfers in applications like file downloads, uploads, or data synchronisation.
  2. Package Management: Displaying the progress of package installation, updates, or downloads in software repositories or package managers.
  3. Education: Providing a user-friendly interface for learning and understanding concurrent process management in real-time.
